\section{Introduction}
In this project, we study the theory behind quantum dots, a highly relevant subject in modern physics. A quantum dot is one or two electrons trapped in an quantum well. These are often referred to as arificial atoms, as they, like natural atoms, have discrete energy levels [2].  

Our goal in this project is to simulate a quantum dot, modelled as one or two electrons bound in a three-dimensional harmonic oscillator well. Quantum Mechanics tells us that we find the behaviour of these electrons by solving the radial equation with the harmonic oscillator potential, $V(r) = \frac{1}{2}m^2\omega^2r^2$:

\begin{equation}
    - \frac{\hbar^2}{2m}(\frac{1}{r^2}\frac{d^2}{dr^2}r^2\frac{d}{dr} - \frac{l(l+1)}{r^2})R(r) + \frac{1}{2}m\omega^2r^2R(r) = ER(r)
\end{equation}
\vspace{3mm}

We do so by rewriting equation (1) with dimensionless variables, and reduce the equation to a single eigenvalue problem, which we solve by implementing Jacobi's rotation method. Thereafter, we compare the obtained wave functions for one and two electrons with and without Couloumb interaction, and interpret the results physically. We also examine what effect the strength of the harmonic potential has on the wave function in the two-electron case.

\section{Theory}
\subsection{One electron}
To solve the Schroedinger's equation (SE) for one electron in a three-dimensional harmic oscillator well, we first assume spherical symmetry, which means we only need to solve the radial part of SE
\begin{equation}
-\frac{\hbar ^2}{2m}\left(\frac{1}{r^2}\frac{d}{dr}r^2\frac{d}{dr} - \frac{l(l+1)}{r^2}\right)R(r) + V(r)R(r) = ER(r),
\label{eq:SEradialgeneral}
\end{equation}
where $\hbar = 6.582 \cdot 10^{-16}$ eV$\cdot$s, $m$ is the electron mass, $r \in [0,\infty)$ the radial distance, $V(r)$ is the potential, $E$ is the energy and $l$ is the orbital quantum number. For our harmonic oscillator the potential is $V(r) = (1/2)kr^2$, with $k=m\omega ^2$. If we look at the case where $l=0$, we get the energies to be $$E_n = \hbar \omega \left(2n + \frac{3}{2}\right).$$ If we also substitute $R(r) = (1/r)u(r)$ in equation (\ref{eq:SEradialgeneral}), the SE we want to solve becomes 
\begin{equation}
-\frac{\hbar ^2}{2m}\frac{d^2}{dr^2} u(r) + V(r) u(r) = Eu(r).
\label{eq:SEradial}
\end{equation}
We introduce the dimensionless variable $\rho = r/\alpha$, which means our potential becomes $V(\rho)= k\alpha ^2 \rho ^2 / 2$. Inserting $\rho$ and $V(\rho)$ into equation (\ref{eq:SEradial}) we get
$$-\frac{d^2}{d\rho ^2}u(\rho) + \frac{mk}{\hbar ^2}\alpha ^4 \rho^2 u(\rho) = \frac{2m\alpha ^2}{\hbar^2}Eu(\rho).$$
We can set $mk\alpha^4/\hbar^2 = 1$ and $2m\alpha^2E/\hbar^2 = \lambda$ which allows us the write the Schroedinger's equation as \begin{equation}
-\frac{d^2}{d\rho ^2}u(\rho) + \rho ^2 u(\rho) = \lambda u(\rho).
\label{eq:SEdimless}
\end{equation}
The second derivative can be expressed as $$u'' \approx \frac{u(\rho + h) - 2u(\rho) + u(\rho -h)}{h^2},$$ where $h$ is the step length. We use $N$ mesh points with $\rho_{min} = \rho_0$ and $\rho_{max} = \rho_N$ which means the step length is $h = (\rho_N - \rho_0)/N$. $\rho$ is discretized by 
\begin{align*}
\rho_i  = \rho _0 + ih && \text{with }i = 1,2,...,N,
\end{align*}
which means we can write our discretized SE as 
\begin{equation}
-\frac{u_{i+1}-2u_i + u_{i-1}}{h^2} + V_i^2u_i = \lambda u_i,
\label{eq:SEdiscretized}
\end{equation}
where $V_i=\rho_i^2$.
The discretized case in eq (\ref{eq:SEdiscretized}) can be written as a linear set of equations 
\begin{equation}
A\textbf{u} = \lambda \textbf{u},
\label{eq:Aulambdau}
\end{equation}
where A is the tridiagonal matrix
\setcounter{MaxMatrixCols}{20}
\begin{equation}
A=\begin{pmatrix}
\frac{2}{h^2} + V_1 && -\frac{1}{h^2} && 0 && ... && 0 && 0 \\
-\frac{1}{h^2} && \frac{2}{h^2} + V_2 && -\frac{1}{h^2} && ... && 0 && 0 \\
0 && -\frac{1}{h^2} && \frac{2}{h^2} + V_3 && ... && 0 && 0 \\
: && : && : && ^{\textbf{.}}. && : && : \\
0 && 0 && 0 && -\frac{1}{h^2} && \frac{2}{h^2} + V_{N-2} && -\frac{1}{h^2} \\
0 && 0 && 0 && 0 && -\frac{1}{h^2} && \frac{2}{h^2} + V_{N-1}.
\end{pmatrix}
\label{eq:A}
\end{equation}
For the potential $V_i = \rho_i^2$, we would expect the three lowest eigenvalues to be $3, 7$ and $11$.
\subsection{Two electrons}
In the case of two electron without repulsive Coulomb interaction our SE is 
$$\left(-\frac{\hbar ^2}{2m}\frac{d^2}{dr_1^2} - \frac{\hbar ^2}{2m}\frac{d^2}{dr_2^2} + \frac{kr_1^2}{2} + \frac{kr_2^2}{2}\right)u(r_1,r_2) = E^{(2)}u(r_1,r_2),$$
where $E^{(2)}$ is the two-electron energy. Introducing a relative coordinate $\textbf{r} = \textbf{r}_1-\textbf{r}_2$ and the center-of-mass coordinate $\textbf{R} = (\textbf{r}_1 + \textbf{r}_2)/2$, we can write SE as
$$\left(-\frac{\hbar ^2}{m}\frac{d^2}{dr^2} - \frac{\hbar ^2}{4m}\frac{d^2}{dR^2} + \frac{kr^2}{4} + kR^2\right)u(r,R) = E^{(2)}u(r,R).$$


The energy can be split into relative energy $E_r$ and the center-of-mass energy $E_R$ as well as $u(r,R) = \psi(r) \phi(R)$. We can then separate the SE into an $r$-dependent part and an $R$-dependent part. The repulsive Coulomb interaction potential between the two electrons is expressed $$V(r_1,r_2) = \frac{\beta e^2}{|\textbf{r}_1-\textbf{r}_2|} = \frac{\beta e^2}{r},$$ where $\beta e^2 = 1.44$ eVnm. 

We are interested in solving the equation with $E_r$, because the $R$-dependent equation is very similar to the case of no repulsive Coulomb interaction. Adding the repulsive Coulomb potential the to $r$-dependent part of SE gives
$$\left(-\frac{\hbar ^2}{m}\frac{d^2}{dr^2} + \frac{kr^2}{4} + \frac{\beta e^2}{r}\right)\psi(r) = E_r\psi(r).$$ 
We again use the dimensionless variable $\rho = r/\alpha$ which gives us 
\begin{equation}
\left(-\frac{d^2}{d\rho ^2} + \frac{mk\alpha ^4 \rho ^2}{4\hbar ^2} + \frac{m\alpha \beta e^2}{\rho \hbar^2}\right)\psi(\rho) = \frac{m\alpha ^2}{\hbar^2}E_r\psi(\rho),
\label{eq:SEdimlessvars}
\end{equation}

which we can simplify and make look like equation (\ref{eq:SEdimless}) by fixing $\alpha$, defining a ''frequency'' $\omega _r$ and ''energy'' $\lambda_r$
\begin{align*}
\frac{m\alpha\beta e^2}{\hbar^2} = 1 && \omega_r^2 = \frac{mk\alpha^4}{4\hbar^2} && \lambda = \frac{m\alpha^2E}{\hbar^2}.
\end{align*}
The equation to solve then becomes \begin{equation}
-\frac{d^2}{d\rho ^2}\psi (\rho) + \omega_r^2\rho^2\psi(\rho) + \frac{1}{\rho}\psi(\rho) = \lambda \psi (\rho),
\label{eq:SEdimlessinteraction}
\end{equation}
which means we can write the potential for the interacting case as $$V_r(\rho) = \omega_r^2\rho^2 + \frac{1}{\rho}$$
and in discretized form $$V_{ir} = \omega_r^2\rho_i^2 + \frac{1}{\rho_i}.$$ The potential for the case where there is no interaction between the two electrons, we simply set $\beta$ to $0$, which means the potential becomes $$V_{nr}(\rho) = \omega_r^2 \rho^2,$$ which for discrete points can be expressed
$$V_{inr} = \omega_r^2\rho_i^2.$$
The eigenvalue-problem in equation (\ref{eq:SEdimlessinteraction}) can then be written as equation (\ref{eq:Aulambdau}), a set of linear equations, where $A$ is as defined in expression (\ref{eq:A}), with the potential $V_{ir}$ for the interacting case and $V_{inr}$ for the case without interaction.
\subsection{Conservation of dot product}
If we consider a set of vectors $\{\textbf{v}_i\}$, an orthogonal matrix U and the transformation $\textbf{w}_i = U\textbf{v}_i$. The dot product for our set of vectors an be expressed as $$\textbf{v}_j^T\textbf{v}_i,$$ which in the case of $\{\textbf{v}_i\}$ being an orthonormal basis means that $\textbf{v}_j^T\textbf{v}_i = \delta_{ij},$ where $\delta_{ij}$ is the Kronecker delta. The dot product of an orthogonal transformation is preserved
$$\textbf{w}_j^T \textbf{w}_i = (U\textbf{v}_j)^TU\textbf{v}_i = \textbf{v}_j^TU^TU\textbf{v}_i = \textbf{v}_j^T\textbf{v}_i,$$ which also means that orthogonality is preserved in the case where $\{\textbf{v}_i\}$ is an orthogonal basis.
\section{Method}
\subsection{Jacobi's method}
In this project we are using Jacobi's method, which transforms a matrix A into a diagonal matrix D with the eigenvalues of A on the diagonal. This is done by repeat setting the largest non-diagonal element equal to zero until all the non-diagonal elements are smaller than a tolerance $\varepsilon$. From linear algebra we know that a symmetric matrix always can be transformed into a diagonal matrix, so this should be valid for our specific symmetric matrix described in the theory. For doing this we need a transformation matrix S which sets the largest non-diagonal element to zero:
\begin{equation}
S^T A S=B
\end{equation}
Where B is the transformed A matrix where the largest non-diagonal element is set to zero. S is given by
\setcounter{MaxMatrixCols}{20}
\begin{equation}
S=\begin{pmatrix} 
1	&&0	&&\hdots		&&0		&&0	&&\hdots	&&0 	&&0\\
0	&&1		&&\hdots&&0&&0&&\hdots&&0&&0\\ \vdots&&\vdots&&\ddots&&\vdots&&\vdots&&\ddots&&\vdots&&\vdots\\ 0&&0&&\hdots&&cos\theta&&0&&\hdots&&0&&sin\theta\\
0&&0&&\hdots&&0&&1&&\hdots&&0&&0\\ \vdots&&\vdots&&\ddots&&\vdots&&\vdots&&\ddots&&\vdots&&\vdots\\ 0&&0&&\hdots&&0&&0&&\hdots&&1&&0\\
0&&0&&\hdots&&-sin\theta&&0&&\hdots&&0&&cos\theta\\
\end{pmatrix}
\end{equation}
where the locations of $sin\theta$ and $-sin\theta$ are depending on the indexes of the largest element of A. Therefore we first need to find this, something we can easily do numerically:
\begin{lstlisting}
max = 0;                     	//Largest element
for(k = [0,size A])
   for(l = [0,size A])
      if(k != l)		//Not on diagonal
         if(abs(A(k,l)) > max)
            kmax = k;		//Store indexes of
            lmax = l;		//largest element
            max = abs(A(k,l));
\end{lstlisting}
After the indexes of the largest element are found, we can start doing the Jacobi method (also called Jacobi rotation since the matrix S is a rotation matrix). By doing the multiplication $S^T AS = B$ for an arbitrary matrix A, we will see that B is constructed by
\begin{itemize}
\item $b_{ii}=a_{ii}\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\,\, i\not=k,\quad i\not= l$
\item $b_{ik}=a_{ik}cos\theta-a_{il}sin\theta\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad i\not=k,\quad i\not= l$
\item $b_{il}=a_{il}cos\theta+a_{ik}sin\theta\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\, i\not=k,\quad i\not= l$
\item $b_{kk}=a_{kk}cos^2\theta-2a_{kl}cos\theta sin\theta +a_{ll}sin^2\theta$
\item $b_{ll}=a_{ll}cos^2\theta+2a_{kl}cos\theta sin\theta +a_{kk}sin^2\theta$
\item $b_{kl}=(a_{kk}-a_{ll})cos\theta sin\theta + a_{kl}(cos^2\theta sin^2\theta)$
\end{itemize}
where $i$ is an arbitrary columns or row index, $k$ is the index of the row with the largest non-diagonal number (in A) and $l$ is the index of the column with the largest non-diagonal number. This makes it easy to find B numerically, and by doing Jacobi's method on B a multiple times, the largest non-diagonal element will constantly be smaller. In the theory these elements should be equal to zero when the diagonal elements are equal to the exact eigenvalues, but we can get a good approximation of the eigenvalues even if the largest element is a small number. We implement this by choosing a small tolerance $\varepsilon$ and continue doing Jacobi's method until the largest element is smaller than this. The smaller $\varepsilon$ is, the better approach we have.\par\vspace{3mm}
The eigenvectors are found by
\begin{equation}
\textbf{w}_i=S\textbf{v}_i
\end{equation}
where \textbf{v} is a basis of eigenvectors, S is the transformation matrix and \textbf{w} are the eigenvectors of A. Numerically we are going to do this by updating the matrix R which is the identity matrix in the beginning. 
\begin{itemize}
\item $R_{il}=cos\theta r_{il}+sin\theta r_{ik}$
\item $R_{ik}=-sin\theta r_{il}+cos\theta r_{ik}$
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Solve the eigenproblem using Armadillo}
We are also finding the eigenvectors and eigenvalues with Armadillo, just to compare them with the eigenvalues and eigenvectors found by Jacobi's method. For a symmetric matrix, this is done by this script:
\begin{lstlisting}
vec eigval;
mat eigvec;
eig_sym(eigval, eigvec, A);
\end{lstlisting}
where we assume that armadillo is included. 

\subsection{Tests}
\subsubsection{Largest element test}
To ensure that the indexes of the non-diagonal largest element are found correctly, we have implemented a test for this. The test is a function which takes $k$ and $l$ as arguments (the indexes of the largest non-diagonal element) and placing the number 1 at this index while the remaining elements are zero. It will not allow us to place the element on the diagonal. Then we have a matrix where we know the exact location of the largest (non-diagonal) element. The next step is to send this matrix into the function which finds the largest element and returns the indexes of this. If this function returns the same indexes as where we placed the largest element, the largest element function passes the test.\par\vspace{3mm}
The reason why we want the test function to take the indexes as arguments, is to be able to vary the test matrix to ensure that the solver is not giving the right result accidentally.\par\vspace{3mm} 
We are also testing if the matrix sent into the largest element finder is quadratic. This is simply done by comparing the number of rows and the number of columns. The test raises an error if the matrix is not quadratic.

\subsubsection{Check of orthogonality}
The eigenvectors should be orthogonal since they cannot be linear combination of each other. This means that the inner product between two different eigenvectors needs to be zero. The mathematical expression can be written as
\begin{equation}
\langle \textbf{v}_i|\textbf{v}_j\rangle =
    \begin{cases}
            c, &         \text{if } i=j,\\
            0, &         \text{if } i\neq j.
    \end{cases}
\end{equation}
where $c$ is a constant. We are not interested in $c$, but we want to check if the inner product between two \textit{different} vectors are zero. The test loops over all the different combinations of eigenvectors (but not equal eigenvectors), and takes the inner product between them. Thereafter it compares the inner product with a given tolerance, and the test passes as long as the inner product is smaller than the tolerance.

\section{Discussion}
From Table 1, we saw that our Jacobi rotation method for finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors was considerably slower than the armadillo method. In fact as the size of the matrix increases the Jacobi method slows down much faster than armadillo, which would suggest that the number of floating point operations in the Jacobi method is of a higher order than that of the armadillo method. 

For the one electron case shown in Figure 1, we saw that higher energies meant that the expected value of the radius grew, which is what we would expect from equation (\ref{eq:SEdimless}). Additionally, for the second and third lowest energies, the probability distributions had several local maxima. These maxima can be interpreted as possible ''orbits'' around the center of the oscillator or if we wish we can think of the as ''orbits'' around a nucleus.

When calculating the eigenvalues $\lambda$, we found as shown in Table 2 that the eigenvalues both depend one the chosen number of grid points $N$ and the boundary condition $\rho_{max}$. In the single electron case we found that $N=350$ and $\rho_{max} = 5$ gave sufficient accuracy. The method was actually quite sensitive to which value of $\rho_{max}$ we chose. When choosing $N$ and $\rho_{max}$, we have to make a compromise between the number of grid points resulting in computing time, and our approximation of infinity $\rho_{max}$. If we wanted to increase our accuracy further, and time or computer memory was of no concern, we could make a better approximation of infinity and use a much larger amount of grid points, which would result in very high accuracy in the eigenvalues and eigenvectors.

The number of iterations as a function of grid points shown in Table 3, appeared to follow the relation $\approx 1.6 N^2$. Interestingly, the time required per iteration increases substantially for larger $N$s. The only part of our algorithm which we would expect to take considerably longer time per iteration for different $N$ values, is the function that searches through our matrix $A$ to find the largest element. This time difference suggests that a large part of the CPU time is spent finding the largest element in our matrix. 
\vspace{1mm}
In Figure 2-5 we observe that for the two electron system the probability distribution comes wider when we lower the value of $\omega$. This is what we would expect since lower $\omega$ corresponds to a weaker potential well, and thus the electrons can move more freely. The maxima of the probability distribution will therefore be found at higher values of $\rho$, which correspond to longer distances between the two electrons. When we choose larger values for $\omega$, the potential well becomes steeper. The electrons are forced toghether, and the maxima of the probability density is found at lower values of $\rho$.
\par
\vspace{2mm}
In Figure 2-5, we also compare the two electron system when we have included the Couloumb interaction between the electrons, and when we have neglected the interaction. The figures show that for lower "frequencies" $\omega$ the difference between the interacting and the non-interacting wave functions becomes larger. This is as expected. When the potential is weaker, the electrons have lower kinetic energy, and the Couloumb interaction is therefore more important than with higher kinetic energies.
\par
\vspace{3mm}

%For the two electron case we found that for lower $\omega$ the probability distribution came wider. which is what we would expect since lower $\omega$s corresponds to a weaker potential well.

%For two electrons we see from figures 2-5 that higher frequencies result in a small difference between the non-interacting and the interacting case. For lower frequencies, the difference is bigger 

\section{Conclusion}
In this project we have seen that the Armadillo algorithm was more efficient than our implemented Jacobi rotation algorithm.  We have also seen that the "frequency" $\omega$ of the harmonic oscillator potential affects the probability distribution of the position of the electrons, and that it affects the non-interacting and the interacting electron system differently. Furthermore, we have seen that when calculating the wave functions, the choice of $\rho_{max}$ is essential for obtaining the correct eigenvalues and -vectors.
